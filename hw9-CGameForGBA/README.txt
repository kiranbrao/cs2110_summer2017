Snek 2: Revenge of Snek is an immersive and original work by independent developer Kiran Rao (GTID: 902891012). Days upon days of planning and self-collaboration have brought to life a masterpiece once thought impossible. Your favorite snake is back at it in a bigger, faster, and more challenging fashion than ever before. Discover the beautifully-authored environment as you learn about and experience the hardships of the animal kingdom and the "growing pains" of survival.   

SYNOPSIS: 
Snek has been through enough, and he's ready to get some revenge. Upon pressing "A" (Z on a keyboard) and starting the game, Snek navigates the open-world using the up, down, left, and right keys. Snek can make its way towards food and consume the food every time it collides with a colored food block, getting sweet, sweet revenge every time it eats. The game continues as Snek becomes bigger and stronger with each food block eaten. Eventually, Snek becomes too power-hungry, and its size and speed ultimately serve as its downfall. A collision between Snek's head and a body part will result in the end of Snek's campaign for revenge, transitioning to a Game Over screen. Just when it seems as all may be lost, the "A" button can be pressed again to restart Snek's revenge-hungry agenda! 

If you ever feel like Snek's rage-fueled desire for revenge is beginning to infect the walls of your conscience,  pressing "Select" (backspace on a keyboard) will reset the game and liberate you from Snek's psychological clutches.
